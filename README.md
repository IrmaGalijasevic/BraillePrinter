# BraillePrinter

## Overview  
BraillePrinter is a group project of three students designed to convert text into Braille and output it in a readable format for visually impaired individuals. This project was developed as part of an embedded systems class to create an affordable and accessible solution for printing text in Braille. It includes a diagram of needed hardware components as well as all of the software to run it. The project demonstrates the integration of mechanical design, microcontroller programming, and text-to-Braille translation algorithms. Here is a video link that showcases the BraillePrinter at work:
